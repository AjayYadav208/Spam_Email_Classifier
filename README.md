Spam Email Classifier Using SVM
Overview
This project implements a spam email classifier using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to enhance email filtering. The classifier processes email text data, trains the model, and evaluates its performance to accurately classify emails as spam or not spam.

Tools & Technologies
Python: Programming language used for implementation.
TF-IDF: For text data conversion into numerical format.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): Classifier used for spam detection.
scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
NLTK: For text preprocessing and cleaning.
Features
Text cleaning and preprocessing of email data.
Conversion of text data into numerical format using TF-IDF.
Training of SVM classifier on the preprocessed data.
Evaluation of the model's performance.
Classification of new emails as spam or not spam.
